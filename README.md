Units of Measurement Spaces

![Space, the final frontier](http://www.funnylinks4all.com/images/movies-phrases/space-the-final-frontier.jpg)

This is a place for Open collaboration projects and events like [Hackerspaces](http://hackerspaces.org/), [Hackergarten](http://hackergarten.net/), [Adopt a JSR](https://java.net/projects/adoptajsr/pages/Home), [Makerfaire](http://makerfaire.com/), [Nighthacking](http://nighthacking.com/) or similar occasions.

## POM
While we provide a Parent POM similar to other repositories, every space and its projects are free to use its own build system or programming language(s) as long as it makes sense in the Units of Measurement context. The license should be an approved [Open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses) but each space and projects may chose an appropriate license, too.
